	<h1> September Song</h1>
	<p> You were my September song<br>
	 Summer lasted too long<br>
	 Time moves so slowly<br>
	 When you're only fifteen<br>
	 You were my September song<br>
	 Tell me where have you gone?<br>
	 Do you remember me?<br>
	 We were only fifteen<br>
	 And I, I remember the chorus<br>
	 They were singing it for us<br>
	 You were my September song<br>
	 Tell me where have you gone?<br>
	 Do you remember me?<br>
	 We were only fifteen<br></p>
